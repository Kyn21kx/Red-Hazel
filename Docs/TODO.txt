TODO:
- Check some timer bugs --- DONE
- Solve the axe's rotation
- Solve axe control bug --- DONE
- Improve overall "feel" of the attack
- Implement the Time class inside the engine instead of outside of it --- DONE


IDEAS:
- To replace the fixed update external setting, and move it to a more internal frame of reference, make the Time.cpp class handle its very own Physx OnFixedUpdate event (working as a sort of game manager)
